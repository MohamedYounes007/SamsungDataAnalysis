# Samsung Data Analysis

This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` which performs the following tasks:
- Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run the script
1. Ensure the Samsung data is in your working directory.
2. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.

The output will be a tidy data set saved as `tidy_data.txt`.
