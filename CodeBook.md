## Variables
- `subject`: The ID of the subject.
- `activity`: The activity performed by the subject.
- `features`: The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

## Data
The data set contains measurements collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Transformations
- Merged the training and test sets to create one data set.
- Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
